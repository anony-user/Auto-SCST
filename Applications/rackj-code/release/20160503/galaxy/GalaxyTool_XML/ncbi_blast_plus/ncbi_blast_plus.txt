Galaxy wrappers for NCBI BLAST+ suite
=====================================

These wrappers are copyright 2010-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

Currently tested with NCBI BLAST 2.2.26+ (i.e. version 2.2.26 of BLAST+),
and does not work with the NCBI 'legacy' BLAST suite (e.g. blastall).

Note that these wrappers (and the associated datatypes) were originally
distributed as part of the main Galaxy repository, but as of August 2012
moved to the Galaxy Tool Shed as 'ncbi_blast_plus' (and 'blast_datatypes').
My thanks to Dannon Baker from the Galaxy development team for his assistance
with this.


Automated Installation
======================

Galaxy should be able to automatically install the dependencies, i.e. the
'blast_datatypes' repository which defines the BLAST XML file format
('blastxml') and protein and nucleotide BLAST databases ('blastdbp' and
'blastdbn').

You must tell Galaxy about any system level BLAST databases using configuration
files blastdb.loc (nucleotide databases like NT) and blastdb_p.loc (protein
databases like NR), and blastdb_d.loc (protein domain databases like CDD or
SMART) which are located in the tool-data/ folder. Sample files are included
which explain the tab-based format to use.

You can download the NCBI provided databases as tar-balls from here:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/ (nucleotide and protein databases like NR)
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/little_endian/ (domain databases like CDD)


Manual Installation
===================

For those not using Galaxy's automated installation from the Tool Shed, put
the XML and Python files in the tools/ncbi_blast_plus/ folder and add the XML
files to your tool_conf.xml as normal (and do the same in tool_conf.xml.sample
in order to run the unit tests). For example, use:

  <section name="NCBI BLAST+" id="ncbi_blast_plus_tools">
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_blastn_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_blastp_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_blastx_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_tblastn_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_tblastx_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_makeblastdb.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_blastdbcmd_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_blastdbcmd_info.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_rpsblast_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_rpstblastn_wrapper.xml" />
    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/blastxml_to_tabular.xml" />
  </section>

You will also need to install 'blast_datatypes' from the Tool Shed. This
defines the BLAST XML file format ('blastxml') and protein and nucleotide
BLAST databases composite file formats ('blastdbp' and 'blastdbn').

As described above for an automated installation, you must also tell Galaxy
about any system level BLAST databases using the tool-data/blastdb*.loc files.

You must install the NCBI BLAST+ standalone tools somewhere on the system
path. Currently the unit tests are written using "BLAST 2.2.26+".

Run the functional tests (adjusting the section identifier to match your
tool_conf.xml.sample file):

./run_functional_tests.sh -sid NCBI_BLAST+-ncbi_blast_plus_tools


History
=======

v0.0.11 - Final revision as part of the Galaxy main repository, and the
          first release via the Tool Shed
v0.0.12 - Implements genetic code option for translation searches.
        - Changes <parallelism> to 1000 sequences at a time (to cope with
          very large sets of queries where BLAST+ can become memory hungry)
        - Include warning that BLAST+ with subject FASTA gives pairwise
          e-values
v0.0.13 - Use the new error handling options in Galaxy (the previously
          bundled hide_stderr.py script is no longer needed).
v0.0.14 - Support for makeblastdb and blastdbinfo with local BLAST databases
          in the history (using work from Edward Kirton), requires v0.0.14
          of the 'blast_datatypes' repository from the Tool Shed.
v0.0.15 - Stronger warning in help text against searching against subject
          FASTA files (better looking e-values than you might be expecting).
v0.0.16 - Added repository_dependencies.xml for automates installation of the
          'blast_datatypes' repository from the Tool Shed.
v0.0.17 - The BLAST+ search tools now default to extended tabular output
          (all too often our users where having to re-run searches just to
          get one of the missing columns like query or subject length)
v0.0.18 - Defensive quoting of filenames in case of spaces (where possible,
          BLAST+ handling of some mult-file arguments is problematic).
v0.0.19 - Added wrappers for rpsblast and rpstblastn, and new blastdb_d.loc
          for the domain databases they use (e.g. CDD, PFAM or SMART).
        - Correct case of exception regular expression (for error handling
          fall-back in case the return code is not set properly).
        - Clearer naming of output files.


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the 'tools' branch of the
following Mercurial repository:
https://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ ./tools/ncbi_blast_plus/make_ncbi_blast_plus.sh

This simplifies ensuring a consistent set of files is bundled each time,
including all the relevant test files.
