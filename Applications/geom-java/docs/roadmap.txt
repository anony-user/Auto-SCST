Roadmap for javageom Library
----------------------------

0.7.0 	
- (done) remove dependency from Shape2D
- (done) deprecate all EMPTY_SHAPES
- (done) deprecate setters for 'simple shapes': vectors, points, transforms.
- (done) move polygon algos into polygon subpackage
- (done) move Polylines into polygon package

0.8.0
- remove all EMPTY_SHAPES
- make simple classes (like Point2D, Vector2D, StraightLine2D...) immutable
- remove inheritance of Point2D from java Point, as this introduces too many
	bug potentialities.

1.0
- (?) complete implementation for lines, polygons and conics in 2D
- Additional algorithms can be provided, as well as additional shapes.
- Partial support of 3D (lines, polygons) can be provided


Decisions:
- simple shapes and objects should be immutable
- equality tests for complex objects: point order is relevant


Other pending questions:
- should Ring2D extends Polyline2D ?
- keep double methods (one with x,y, other with point2D) when using points ?
- introduce finite grids
- introduce points in homogeneous coordinates ?
- introduce Direction2D ?
- introduce exception for parallel line ?


Version numbering:
pattern: javaGeom-x.y.z, or javaGeom-x.y.z-dd
first digit incremented following major refactoring of the code
second digit incremented when many new features are added, or when many
	classes or methods have been changed
third digit is incremented for bug fixes, and addition of small new features
two additional digits can be added for the addition of few bug fixes compared
	to the previous version
