/**
 * Contains the image points that define the IM image raster pattern.
 *
 * A raster pattern is the array of presentation device pels that forms
 * the image. The image data is uncompressed. Bits are grouped into
 * bytes and are ordered from left to right within each byte. Each bit
 * in the image data represents an image point and is mapped to
 * presentation device pels as specified in the IOC structured field.
 * A bit with value B'1' indicates a significant image point; a bit
 * with value B'0' indicates an insignificant image point.
 * Image points are recorded from left to right in rows that represents
 * scan lines (X direction), and rows representing scan lines are
 * recorded from top to bottom (Y direction). When the image is
 * presented, all image points in a row are presented before any
 * image points in the next sequential row are presented, and all rows
 * have the same number of image points. If the total number of image
 * points is not a multiple of 8, the last byte of the image data is
 * padded to a byte boundary. The padding bits do not represent image
 * points and are ignored by presentation devices.
