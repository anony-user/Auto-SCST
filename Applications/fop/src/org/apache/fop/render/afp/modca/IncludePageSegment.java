/**
 * The Include Page Segment structured field references a page segment resource
 * object that is to be presented on the page or overlay presentation space. The IPS
 * specifies a reference point on the including page or overlay coordinate system that
 * may be used to position objects contained in the page segment. A page segment
 * can be referenced at any time during page or overlay state, but not during an
 * object state. The page segment inherits the active environment group definition of
 * the including page or overlay.
 *
 * Note : No use for Triplets.
 *
 * A 'real' example for where this will be used is for
 * the dynamic placing of overlay objects, such as signatures
 * that may have to be placed at different positions on a document.
