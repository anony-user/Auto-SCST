ID3iconv
</h2>

<p>ID3iconv is a little Java command line tool to convert ID3 tags in
mp3 files from whatever machine encoding you have (GB2312/GBK for
Chinese, etc) to Unicode.  It convert both ID3v1 tags and ID3v2 tags
to Unicode-encoded ID3v2 (v2.3 or v2.4). This is sometimes useful because,

</p><ul>

<li> ID3v1 or v2 don't really supports multi-byte encodings such as GBK or Big5.  Most
existing files falsely pretend they are ISO-8859-1 encoded.  This
means the softwares handle them in all kinds of weird ways.</li>

<li> Even if the user can force the encoding in some players, it is then
impossible to display tags of several international languages at the same time
if files are so encoded.

</li></ul>

<p>I wrote this to convert all my mp3 files with Chinese (both simplified and traditional Chinese) tags to
Unicode and play them using <a href="http://www.rhythmbox.org/">Rhythmbox</a> under Linux.  This is after much
struggle with XMMS and other players that either cannot handle the large charsets
GBK/GB18030 or cannot handle Chinese at all.

</p><p>CAUTION: The tool updates mp3 files in place.  So backup if you
don't want to lose your precious music...

</p><h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li>2/20/2004, repacked binary package available.

  <br>The old 0.2.1 binary package failed to run under Blackdown 1.4.1 VM.  This should fix the problem.

</li><li>2/16/2004, ID3iconv 0.2.1 available.

  <br>Bug fix: conversion speed very slow sometimes because
  non-buffered I/O used.

</li><li>2/14/2004, ID3iconv 0.2 available.  Added the following features,
  <br>Option to force using id3v1 tag even if v2 tag exists
  <br>Option to remove v1 tag after convertion
</li></ul>

<h3>Download</h3>

Make sure you have a recent <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java Virtual Machine</a>.  Then use

<pre>java -jar &lt;ID3iconv jar file&gt; &lt;mp3 files&gt;</pre>

to convert your mp3 files.

</p><h3>FAQ</h3>

<p><b>What does it actually do to my files?</b>

</p><blockquote>
ID3iconv takes all text fields of your tag, assume they are in a certain encoding (specified by -e or 
using system default), and convert them to their Unicode equivalence as supported by ID3 v2.3.
If the file has only v1 tag before, a v2 tag will be prepended to the beginning of the file.
If the file has non-unicode v2 tag before, it will be converted to unicode format.
You also have the option to remove any existing v1 tag after conversion is done.
The output encoding is Unicode little endian, which seems to be the most compatible.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Does it convert all fields of the tag?</b>

</p><blockquote>It converts all text fields (fields with name Txxx in
ID3v2), except those marked as numerical text, such as TYER, as defined
in ID3 v2.3 text.</blockquote>

<p><b>What encoding does ID3iconv assume the original tags are in?</b>

</p><blockquote>The encoding can be specified via the -e option, using Java encoding names, as 
listed <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html">here</a>. 
If no encoding is specified, the default OS encoding will be used.  This is normally determined 
by the local setting of your operating system.  E.g., on *NIX, look at LC_CTYPE output of 'locale'.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What players can view tags in converted mp3 files?</b> <br>

</p><blockquote>

Unfortunately a lot of players don't handle Unicode tags well, mostly because these
files are rare, although there should be more.  Here's my results.
<br><b>Players that handle unicode tags correctly</b>

<ul>
<li>Rhythmbox 0.6.5.  Gnome's default music player.</li>
<li>iTunes for windows.</li>
<li>Windows explorer's file property dialog for MP3 files</li>
</ul>

<b>Players that I haven't got working with Unicode tags</b>
<ul>
<li>Winamp 5.  It seems to be treating all tags as the machine's native encoding, even if they are 
clearly marked as in Unicode</li>

<li>Foobar 0.7.7b w and w/o id3v2 component.  The Id3v2 component also generates
wrongly-formatted Unicode tags (missing leading BOM characters), which only itself can
recognize. :(</li>

<li>XMMS (One workaround is to use id3v1 tags by disabling v2 tag
support, Open options -&gt; preferences -&gt; Audio I/O plugins -&gt;
MPEG Layer 1/2/3 Player and click on "configure" at the "title" tab you
will have an option "Disable ID3V2 tag" - chek it and xmms will use old
ID3V1 tags. Thanks go to Alexandr Dmitrijev for pointing this out).</li>
</ul>
